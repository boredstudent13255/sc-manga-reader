Prologue
</p>

<br>

<p>
In the reception room of a certain trading company. Across a long table, I was facing a man. The room was furnished with reasonably high-quality pieces, suggesting the good fortune of my business partner. As I was casually observing these furnishings, it seemed my counterpart had finished reviewing the contract.
</p>
<p>
I, Claire François, looked at the head of this trading company under the governance of the Margrave of the Nur Empire's borderlands. Beneath rich golden hair not yet touched by gray, a pair of brown eyes seemed to be appraising me.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"The contract fee was...how much again?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"One million gold per year, with the premise of renewing the contract annually."
</p>

<br>

<p>
Lene, who was standing by my side, answered smoothly. While I am the one responsible, I leave the detailed figures and contract clauses to her. She is my reliable right hand.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"It seems rather expensive. You speak of lending a vigilante group, but you're women and children, aren't you?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"It's a fair price. We of the François Trading Company provide the highest quality service. In return, we receive appropriate compensation."
</p>
<p class="quote">
“So, you’re not willing to negotiate the fee?”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"This is already the amount after more than sufficient discount. Any further reduction would force us to lower the quality of our service."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The head of the company stroked his beard thoughtfully. Oh, here we go again… I said, exasperated: </p>

<br>

<p class="quote"> “You’re welcome to underestimate us for being women and children, but it’s you who will suffer in the end.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"What do you mean?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"The Empire's national policy is thorough meritocracy, is it not? If word gets out that you undervalued us and our capabilities, word will reach the Margrave - and by extension, Her Majesty Dorothea."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"!"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Should that happen, your trading company would be hanging by a thread. If you lack the eye to properly assess an opponent's worth, you'd have no place in the Empire. We would also prefer not to deal with such a counterpart. If you're dissatisfied, please seek elsewhere."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I gave Lene a nod, and we prepared to leave--
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I was in the wrong! Let’s proceed with the contract.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Very well. Then, please sign here."
</p>

<br>

<p>
After that, the contract proceeded entirely at our pace. We exchanged contracts, shared a business smile and handshake at the end, then left the trading company.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Good work, Miss Claire."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Good work, Lene. We had a bit of trouble again this time. The world still undervalues the work of women and children.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Even so, the Empire is better in this regard. As Miss Claire mentioned during negotiations, there's the meritocracy policy, and Her Majesty Emperor Dorothea is a woman."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"But even so, it becomes like this in the borderlands. It gives me a headache."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I boarded the carriage for our return.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“...We’re finally gaining momentum, Lene.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
“Yes. Thanks to your brilliance, Miss Claire.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
“No, Lene. I wouldn’t have come this far without you.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
I thought back to when I was reunited with Lene. That was about five years ago…
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="yeartext">
Chapter One: Revival
</p>

<br>

<p>
A small room furnished with the bare minimum befitting a noble.
</p>
<p>
Gone was any trace of the François House's former splendor, and surrounded by furnishings that possessed only a token degree of quality and refinement, I was at the depths of despair.
</p>
<p>
A revolution had erupted in Bauer, and nearly all royalty and nobles were executed.  This included even Prince Rod and the others, and my close friends were among the first to vanish on the execution platform.
</p>
<p>
Among all this, I alone managed to preserve my life. The reason I was saved was due to the intercession of Manaria onee-sama, who had led the Sousse army to prevent the Nur Empire's invasion during Bauer's revolution. She petitioned for my life as compensation for her military achievements, and I was placed under her custody. Since then, I’ve been living as the adopted daughter of a frontier Margrave in Sousse.
</p>
<p>
I tended to shut myself in my room. I had no motivation to do anything, and my head was filled only with regrets. Why did I survive? Why didn't I die together with Father and the others? Of course, I felt gratitude toward Manaria onee-sama. But truly, I would have preferred to meet my end as a Bauer noble rather than live on disgracefully.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"My lady, you have a visitor."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I don't wish to see anyone. I'm sorry, but please ask them to leave."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"However, the visitor insists, and bears a letter of recommendation from Her Majesty Manaria."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"...From onee-sama? What is the visitor's name?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Lene Aurousseau of the Aurousseau Trading Company."
</p>

<br>

<p>
That name lit a heat in my heart that had been sealed in emptiness—a warmth I hadn't felt in so long.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Show them in at once—ah, wait! I must change clothes first!"
</p>

<br>

<p class="scene-divider">
◆◇◆◇◆
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire!"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Lene! You're safe..."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire too... you must have endured such painful experiences."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I hugged Lene. Meeting her again after so long, she seemed to have grown taller and her build appeared larger than before.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire, you've grown thin."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Not particularly."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"That's a lie. I heard from Lady Manaria that you've been eating poorly for quite some time. I came here because Lady Manaria arranged it."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Onee-sama did..."
</p>

<br>

<p>
Even after becoming Queen of Sousse, onee-sama always concerns herself with me. I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful, but... I'm already...
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire, is this acceptable?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Eh?"
</p>

<br>

<p>
With unexpectedly strong eyes, Lene stared directly at me. I couldn't understand what she was trying to say.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I can understand as a former commoner that the revolution came about through the citizens' wishes. However, I cannot accept that Master Dole was branded with the disgrace of being a corrupt noble!!"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"—!"
</p>

<br>

<p>
Lene's words pierced my chest with a stabbing pain. The François House had been inscribed in Bauer's history as the foremost among the corrupt nobles who had distorted the nation. An indelible stain. I too felt uncontrollable anger about this fact. But I was surprised that it was spoken from Lene's mouth.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I thought... you would resent Father."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Master Dole was certainly strict. But that was toward himself as well. Master Dole, who was the exemplar of the fine old nobility, could never have engaged in corruption."
</p>

<br>

<p>
Having said that much, Lene took my hands.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"At this rate, the true nature of the François House will be buried in the darkness of history. Miss Claire, is this acceptable to you!? Only you can clear the dishonor of Master Dole and Lady Melia!"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Lene..."
</p>

<br>

<p>
Tears welled up in Lene's eyes. I had made Lene—not family, not even nobility, just a servant—say such things.
</p>
<p>
And yet, what are you doing, you who are their daughter, Claire François!
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"—Control yourself, Lene."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"...Miss Claire?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"To whom do you think you're speaking so presumptuously? Who do you think I am?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"—Miss Claire François. My beloved and supreme master!"
</p>

<br>

<p>
Lene must have understood my change. Her usual smile returned to her face.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I was merely taking a little rest. But I've grown rather tired of that too. You appeared at just the right time, Lene."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Then...?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Yes."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I stood up from the bed.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I shall begin moving... toward the revival of the François House."
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="yeartext">
Chapter Two: The François Women's Trading Company
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"A new commercial organization...?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Indeed."
</p>

<br>

<p>
Before me sat my adoptive mother, who was also the Margrave of the Sousse Kingdom's borderlands. Despite being a woman, she was entrusted with border territories facing enemy nations, and was a female politician who enjoyed deep trust from Her Majesty, Manaria onee-sama. To such an adoptive mother, I had submitted a business proposal for the new venture I would be starting.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Hmm... interesting, but... let me hear the intent behind this plan."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I analyzed this territory in my own way. While you govern this land very well, I believe there are still issues troubling you.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Continue."
</p>

<br>

<p>
My adoptive mother urged me to continue while reviewing the proposal.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"One is the decrease in working population due to depopulation. Young men, especially those in their prime working years, are leaving for the capital or more central areas.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
When the working population decreases, the territory's power necessarily declines. No matter how excellent a lord's governance, population sometimes exerts an undeniable influence.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“Second is the harsh environment faced by women and children—the socially vulnerable. Women, who comprise half the population, as well as small children, suffer from various difficulties. Undervaluation, low wages, violence... and the list goes on."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Hmm. I was aware of these problems as well. But I couldn't easily solve them either. Can you do something about it, Claire?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"That's what this new organization is for. Please look at page twelve of the materials."
</p>

<br>

<p>
When I prompted her, she flipped to the page. I continued.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“We build strength in numbers by forming solidarity among the vulnerable. Anyone wishing to form a contract with women or children in this territory must go through our organization. We’ll also audit existing contracts and void any unjust terms.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
This would prevent women and children from being exploited. But it wasn’t just about protecting the weak.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"This naturally has the purpose of improving their status, but separately, it also has the aspect of expanding the working population."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I'd like an explanation."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Understood. As I mentioned earlier, women comprise half the population. Add children and it's even more. Currently, they have poor working conditions, and many who want to work cannot. If we improve treatment, we can add this demographic to the working population."
</p>

<br>

<p>
In other words, we would pull women and children into the main stage of the male-dominated labor market. And that's not all.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"A territory where social vulnerables can work easily, this isn't just pretty words. Such rumors spread. Currently, frankly speaking, there are no territories pursuing this type of policy. We can expect to attract migrant workers from surrounding territories."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I see, it seems like a good plan. But there would be problems specific to women and children, wouldn't there?"
</p>

<br>

<p>
As expected of mother, known as a heroine. She sees that it's not all smooth sailing.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"You're absolutely right. For example, having children work at all would be a subject of debate. There are several issues to consider, such as physical weakness, women's monthly cycles, or relative passivity."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"How would you handle those?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Regarding children and labor, if left alone, they would starve. While we'll need to reconsider this in the future, presenting the option of work could be a catalyst for changing the current situation."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Hmm, persuasive."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"As for physical weakness, I think it can be compensated for to some extent with magic. Also, when it comes to women's menstrual cycles, there are many ways to work around it, such as coordinating shifts with others."
</p>

<br>

<p>
And what about the relative passivity of socially disadvantaged groups compared to adult men?
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“I think the idea that women and children are passive or submissive is nothing more than a myth.”  
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Oh?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I believe it appears that way because of the historical circumstances in which the disadvantaged have been placed. Of course, I don't think all socially disadvantaged individuals possess the same temperament as adult men. However, if we improve their treatment and environment, I believe women and children will become more proactive in their endeavors."  
</p>
<p class="quote">
"That sounds reasonable, but do you have sufficient grounds to convince me?"
</p>

<br>

<p>
There, my adoptive mother turned stern eyes toward me. I met her gaze without backing down.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“You yourself, Mother. You’re the strongest refutation of the idea that women are passive by nature.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
When I said this with conviction, she looked bewildered for a moment, then:
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Hahaha! Indeed! Ah, if anyone said such a thing, I'd hit them hard."
</p>

<br>

<p>
After laughing heartily, she returned the proposal to me and said:
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"You've thought of something interesting. Very well. Go ahead and try it."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Thank you!"
</p>

<br>

<p>
Thus, the establishment of the François Trading Company was officially approved.
</p>

<br>

<p class="scene-divider">
◆◇◆◇◆
</p>

<br>

<p>
Getting the trading company on track was quite difficult. First, since there was no precedent, it was hard to get the women and children themselves to form concrete images. Sousse was dominated by relatively conservative values, and women and children who had internalized these found it beyond imagination to work shoulder-to-shoulder with adult men. This tendency was particularly strong among commoners, who held strong preconceptions that women and children belonged beneath men. We continued patient explanation and negotiation, but change was minimal.
</p>
<p>
The tide turned when we met a certain girl.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"...Really, can women live as well as men~?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Yes. It might not be immediate, but certainly in the not-too-distant future."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The girl was called Mao Ne. She was a ten-year-old girl working at an inn run by a certain man. She was very hardworking, diligently attending to the inn's work from morning to night. However, her wages were extremely low, and her life seemed difficult.
</p>
<p>
In such circumstances, she heard rumors about the François Trading Company and came to my mansion, which served as the company's headquarters.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"It's a rather hard-to-believe story, but if Lady Claire says so~ I'd like to try believing it~"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Oh? Did I know you? I'm sorry, I don't remember."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"It's no wonder you don't know me~. I only knew of you one-sidedly~"
</p>

<br>

<p>
This was during the period when I was still sunk in despair. Mao Ne had been working multiple jobs at the time, one of which was kitchen duties at the margrave's mansion. One day, she came to my room to clear away a meal tray and, seeing that I hadn't touched it at all, involuntarily frowned. When she panicked upon realizing her disrespect, I apparently said:
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I'm sorry for not eating what you prepared so carefully. Every grain of wheat, every drop of wine is made from the blood taxes of you people."
</p>

<br>

<p>
According to her, while this was just parroting what Lene had told me repeatedly, at that time Mao Ne was surprised to find there were nobles like this. She became the first general member of the trading company.
</p>
<p>
Her treatment didn't improve immediately. Rather, her employer, displeased with her joining the trading company, even tried to dismiss her. Her colleagues also gave her "I told you so" looks, but this didn't last long. The trading company protested to the employer and forced them to retract the dismissal.
</p>
<p>
From there, the tide turned dramatically. The fact that the guild had protected a commoner girl without abandoning her left a strong impression on her colleagues. First, they joined the guild, and soon their families, relatives, and acquaintances... the numbers grew rapidly.
</p>
<p>
What was a bit concerning was that a significant number of orphans and displaced persons from Bauer had joined. It later became clear that political corruption had become severe in Bauer. Although a clean political system was initially aimed for after the revolution, the inexperienced group that had executed the entire old regime was unable to handle the dark side of politics.
</p>
<p>
Politics cannot run on idealism alone. It is impossible to avoid the most difficult part of managing contradictions, injustices, and conflicts to find a compromise. And in current Bauer, this role was being filled by criminal groups outside society. The collusion between politics and anti-social organizations was definitely corroding Bauer society. And it is women and children who are the first to fall victim to such corruption. The fact that they found a refuge was an unexpected stroke of luck.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Don't you resent them?"
</p>

<br>

<p>
Lene once asked me this. Indeed, they were the ones who ended the François House. But that's that, and this is this. The trading company's principles take priority above all else.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire, let's create a vigilante group soon too."
</p>

<br>

<p>
At Lene's suggestion, we gathered former adventurers and magicians who were confident in their abilities and formed a vigilante group, gaining the practical power to counter violence. At this point, the structure of social weakness and powerlessness disappeared.
</p>
<p>
When people increase, wisdom increases too. Those who had been doing housework provided possibilities for businesses in the domestic sphere, those who had worked hard in agriculture offered improvement proposals for farming, women with child-rearing experience and children who were stakeholders provided educational know-how, and we turned these into house-cleaning services, agricultural technology services, and tutoring services respectively.
</p>
<p>
Five years after its foundation, the trading company had grown into a major business organization renowned throughout and beyond the Sousse Kingdom.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"You did it, Miss Claire."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Lady Claire~ you're amazing~"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"It's thanks to everyone. But this is just the beginning."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The reputation of the thriving François Trading Company finally reached even the Nur Empire. On one such day, a letter arrived for me.
</p>

<br>

<p>
—I am interested in you. Let me hear your story. Nur Empire Emperor Dorothea Nur
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="yeartext">
Chapter Three - Audience with the Empress
</p>

<br>

<p>
Nur Empire Empress Dorothea Nur is known as a tyrant. She successively invades neighboring countries, welcoming those who submit willingly and thoroughly crushing those who resist, making her a terrifying dictator.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, her talents as a ruler receive more than modest evaluation, particularly her attitude of objectively assessing individual abilities, which is highly praised. Capable personnel from vassal states are gathered in the Nur Empire, and some apparently live better than before annexation.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"...Rather dubious. Besides, no matter how much one's living improves, how could anyone be satisfied with having their homeland destroyed, unless the original country's politics were exceptionally bad?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Normally one would bear grudges."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"But~ it does seem true that the Nur Empire's national power is rising~?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"How mysterious."
</p>

<br>

<p>
We were in a carriage heading to the imperial capital, responding to such an invitation from Her Majesty Dorothea. The imperial capital visible through the windows did indeed appear prosperous, and it seemed certain that her so-called meritocracy policies were achieving some success.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Miss Claire, are you nervous?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"...A little. I don't know what Her Majesty Dorothea wants to know about us, but if we could secure the emperor's backing, it would be an unparalleled advance for the trading company."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The Nur Empire is one of the world's great powers, with influence extending globally. If we could receive endorsement from such a country's emperor, the trading company's authority would rise to a position far beyond what it had been.
</p>

"I am Dorothea Nur. Raise your heads."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The first time I saw Her Majesty, I couldn’t help but be captivated by her undeniable charisma. Her hair and eyes shone flame-colored, and instead of robes, she wore jet-black armor. Just sitting on the throne with her cheek resting on her hand, casually sending her gaze this way, she possessed an indescribable charm that made one want to remain in her field of vision as long as possible. She, who possessed incomparable power in martial arts as well, held the title "Sword God," the epithet of the world's strongest swordsman. Indeed, though she appeared full of openings, there wasn't a single gap in her defense. The distance between us was over ten meters, but I was convinced that if we showed hostile intent, our heads would be severed the next instant, such was the martial authority I felt.

“No need for pleasantries. I prefer rationality. I'll be direct. Claire François, become mine."

"!?"
</p>

<br>

<p>
My diplomatic protocol was completely derailed, and I was momentarily confused. However, having conducted numerous business negotiations and dealt with royalty and nobility many times, I instantly regained my composure and attempted to retake control of the conversation.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"If I may, Your Majesty. What do you mean by that? That the François Trading Company may work in your country?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"No. I have no interest in the trading company. What I want is you alone, Claire François."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I'm shaken. I can't read Emperor Dorothea's intent.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"What about me has caught Your Majesty's fancy?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I have no interest in the trading company, but your skill in organizing a new group is rare. You're worthy of joining my retinue."
</p>

<br>

<p>
It's an honorable offer. It is, but this isn't the form we had hoped for. However, if I were to simply refuse, my lifespan would end right there.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
“I am honored. And what are the terms?”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I'll prepare a high-ranking bureaucrat position."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Surely you jest. You underestimate me if you think you can make me yours with such treatment."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"M-Miss Claire!"
</p>

<br>

<p>
Right beside me, Lene let out a scream-like voice. Please understand, Lene. This is a negotiation.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Then what do you want?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I would like to be enrolled among the imperial nobility."
</p>

<br>

<p>
This isn't my true desire. What I seek is the revival of the François House as Bauer nobility. Becoming imperial nobility would be meaningless.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"You aim high. No matter how capable you might be, I don't think you have that much value. If you were your father, Dole François, that would be different."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"How disappointing. I thought Your Majesty had the world's best eye for people."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Insolent. Then let me propose this. For that purpose, could you destroy your homeland?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"!?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I don't mind enrolling the François House as nobility of my country. But in exchange, you will devote yourself to conquering Bauer."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I had thought I was making an impossible demand, but I never expected to be given terms in exchange. This is a wish I requested myself. If I mishandle my response, I'll probably die.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Let me hear your answer."
</p>

<br>

<p>
My answer is—
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"I decline."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Hmm. I'll hear your reason. Be careful. Depending on the content, your life ends here."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"To overthrow the current Bauer government, Your Majesty's assistance is unnecessary. I will destroy them with my own power and show you."
</p>
<p class="quote">
“...Is it hatred? How pathetic.”
</p>
<p class="quote">
"It would be a lie to say I bear no grudges. However, this is my way of life. To clear the dishonor of my late father and house, stained under the name of revolution. Nobility is not about status or power. It is about one's way of life.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
I've said it. Perhaps my life ends here. But I cannot compromise on this. If I were to bend here and survive, wouldn't that be the same as during the revolution?
</p>

"...Kuku...kuhahaha! You've roared well! The height of irrationality."

<p class="quote">
"I consider it an undeserved honor."

"But interesting. You're too valuable to cut down here. Surpass Dole François. When you've grown more, I'll take you under my command again."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"I'm grateful."

<br>

<p>
It seems I've managed to preserve my life for now.

Epilogue - From Here On
</p>

<br>

<p>
A frail girl is about to collapse. She probably hasn't eaten for days. Having fought and fought against hardship, she's finally about to give up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I won't allow such a thing. I firmly grasped her hand and caught her small body. The sheer lightness of it brought frustration welling up.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"...Who...are you?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"My name is Claire François. I've come to help you, brave ones."
</p>
<p class="quote">
"You'll...help us...?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Yes. Lene, bring a stretcher here too! There are injured people!"
</p>

<br>

<p>
After our audience with Her Majesty Dorothea, we headed straight to Bauer. We’d heard of impending civil unrest. I asked for and received permission from Her Majesty to act freely there.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"Very well. Let me see how you will destroy Bauer."
</p>
<p class="quote">
“But only through conviction,” I added.
</p>
<p class="quote">
"Destroying Bauer—but through conviction, right?"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"That's so like Lady Claire~"
</p>
<p class="quote">
"You're so noisy."
</p>

<br>

<p>
I'm different from the me of that time, steeped in resentment. The current me has conviction and ideals. I don't care about Bauer's politicians. I simply want to stop the tears.
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"This time I'll stop it. Father, Mother, please lend me your strength."
</p>

<br>

<p>
The François Trading Company showed brilliant success on all fronts. The vigilante group suppressed riots, women cooperated in treatment, and children, utilizing their mobility and small statures, contributed to finding the wounded and sick. The trading company's ideal of the weak joining forces to rescue the even weaker was embodied here and now. The civil war remained merely attempted—this time I made it in time.
</p>
<p>
Many would later testify: that there was an organization that rushed throughout Bauer to prevent civil war. That the leader of that organization was the daughter of a noble family they had once ostracized.
</p>
<p>
In the Bauer Restoration Kingdom established after the civil war, it was soon after that a distinguished family once branded with dishonor was enrolled among the nobility for their achievements.
</p>
<p>
The name of the François House had now brilliantly regained its radiant place in history.

Afterword
</p>

<br>

<p class="bigtext">Isn't it a bug that Lady Claire can't be romanced?</p>

<br>

<p>
Ahem. Sorry, my true feelings and desires leaked out completely. This is the circle "Lady Claire is My Wife," participating in Comiket for the first time. As this is our first attempt at a doujinshi, there were probably many unsightly aspects, but we packed it full of love. It's strange that Lady Claire only has bad endings. If that's the only fate available, then the world itself must be wrong. Don't you think so? You do, don't you? Mmhmm.
</p>
<p>
In publishing this book, thanks to “Horeta Yokume”-san for their cooperation. Without your illustrations, this book's appeal would have been reduced by 80%. Sorry for the impossible deadline schedule. Thanks also to “Akujo”-san and “Akujo no Yome”-san for proofreading and idea proposals. Come on, you two should stop worrying about your parents and get together already. Invite me to the wedding.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who read this book. Thank you!
