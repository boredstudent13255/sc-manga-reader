    <!--Tells the generator where to place each entry relative to the invisible placement point. "beforebegin" will place the first numbered entry at the top and the last at the bottom. "afterend" will do the reverse. Functionally, anything but "afterend" will be read as "beforebegin".-->

These are NOT chapter numbers, these are entry numbers containing a pointer to a chapter. Note also that the series ID is contained in every entry, this is to allow for including chapters which are internally treated as being from a different series.-->
